# About Me
Hello, I am DanK. This is my new GitHub account, after my old one (DanK-Official) got hacked and I couldn't get it back.

Here are some things about me:
1. I am currently learning JavaScript, Java and <s>Script</s>- I mean C.
2. I like Markdown. I mean, I really enjoy using Markdown to document things.
3. I have found a LOT of glitches in Roblox, from magnetism to making players lighter.
4. I speak 3 languages: English, Español (Latin American) and فارسی (just a little bit).
5. I live in Houston. Yes, the weather is very dynamic and yes, it is very popular.

Things I'm working on:
-  BetterClient: A script Roblox developers put into their games to make the user experience better, adding numerous quality-of-life improvements to the Roblox experience.
-  Starting to learn more languages that could benefit me in the future.

My progress:
